# Lottery-Web
## Introduction
For my project I decided to make a Lottery Game Website where users can find out how much prize money they won. Their lucky number and lucky colour is generated in this website and the prize they win is based off the lucky number and lucky colour they recieve.

The following services will be implemented as stated:
* Service 1 - Frontend service for users to interact the application with. This is also responsible for communicating with other 3 services along with use of database
* Service 2 - Generates a random object. In my case it is going to generate any random colour from Red, Yellow, Green.
* Service 3 - Also generates a random object. For this project, it is going to generate a random single digit number ranging from 0 to 9
* Service 4 - Create an object according to the output generated by service 2 and 3. So based off the colour and the number generated by service 2 and service 3, service 4 will create a prize money.

## Software Design

### Project Tracking board
I used a ansana board app to track progress in my project.

The link for this ansana board can be found here https://app.asana.com/0/1200791323481567/1200791323481567

### Entity Relationship Diagram
For my entity Diagram, I did not require relationships between multiple entities since the user would most likely be concerned with what they won rather than finding out what other users have won. I started off with having entity regarding indiviual prize that user won as shown below:

But then I decided to make changes such as renaming and removing attributes. There could be multiple data having identical attributes, so rather than focusing on individual prize money outcome, I chose to keep record of every outcome every made.

### User Story
Considering the point of view of end users, there are features to end-users that end users would like to do. The following user stories explores the end-goal that a user would like to obtain at first glance.

First User Story

* As a User
* I want to create my lucky number and lucky colour
* So that I can start the game and play

Second User Story

* As a User
* I want to view my lucky number and lucky colour
* So that I can make sure I am getting the correct prize money

Third User Story

* As a User
* I want to be able to view the amount of prize money I won
* So that I know how much I won

I later then thought it would be more helpful if the website provided some game rules and also have additional information the end user would like

Fourth User Story

* As a User
* I want to read the rules of the game
* So that I know the what prizes are available and what I need to obtain those prize

Fifth User Stor

* As a User
* I want to look at the history of prizes I have won
* So that I can keep track of my prizes

Sixth User Story
* As a User
* I want to look at the total prize money I have won so far
* So that I can make sure the total adds up to the history of the game


### CI Pipeline
CI pipeline is a digram for continous integration where it contains all the necessary tools for allowing automated code testing.

### Infrastructure Diagram
Infrastructure Diagram presents the Virtual Machine used in the project and also how they are communicated accross one another.

### Risk Assessment
For my risk assessment, I reviewed my risk assessment from previous project and found many risks that could take place this time again and therefore kept those relevant for this current project and got rid of the one that was not relavent. The section highlighted in green is the one that had been added later on while I was in the development phase of the project. My risk assessment can be accessed in this link https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qKrBP5lmSZ_y09coKmy1kLTeaUtdBJFx14fz_hG7THU/edit?usp=sharing.

## Project Outcome

### Front End
Upon visiting the website, the game starts. We have won £800 in this case and have so far won total of £19552

![Web1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63979521/129561445-7364f027-52a0-494a-b281-e9e48059d460.png)

Once we press refresh, the game starts again. Now we won £1 and therefore our total prize changed to £19553
